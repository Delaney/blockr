## BlockrBot

BlockrBot is a Twitter bot that allows users  block other users by simply sending a Direct Message. Any handles in the message will be blocked.

Users can also send a tweet of a user to the bot and have that user blocked. This could be used to create a memento of why you blocked that user.
